# Note_Taker_Erin_Mulcahey

## Description

The goal was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end, then saves and retreives note data from a JSON file. My motivation for creating this application was to give the user a way to easiy take and keep notes or reminders then read and or delete the notes at a later time. It can be helpful to some people if they have a way of keeping track of thoughts and a place to put all those thoughts. This application allows the user to choose their own note title then to type what ever they'd like to include within the body of the note. I learned how to build the back end, connect the back end to the front end, and then deploy an application to Render.

## Usage

A user will first be greeted with the main note taker website. To enter the page that allows them to add and delete notes, they will need to click on the 'Get Started' button. When a user is on the note taker pagen they can click into the typing ares that say 'Note Title' and 'Note Text' where they can then enter a title and the body of their note. Once both areas are filled in they can click the save button or the clear note button.

When a note is saved, it will show up in the notes list on the left side of the page. A user can click on any note in the list and have it brought up on the right side of the screen which will allow them to view the whole note. If a user no longer wants a specific note to be on the list, they can click the red trash can button to delete the note.
